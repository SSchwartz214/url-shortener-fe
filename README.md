### Description

This application generates shortened URL's from user inputted URL's.  A background worker is used to scrape the websites for their titles. Additionally, there is a top 100 page that ranks and displays the URL's based on visits.

### Running the Server Locally

To see the code in action locally, you need to fire up a development server. Use the command:

```

Once the server is running, visit in your browser:

* [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### Algorithm 
My method "generate_short" on the Rails backend API (https://github.com/SSchwartz214/url_shortener) takes the database id for a url and converts it into itâ€™s Base 36 equivalent.  Since every url has a unique id no url will ever have the same Base 36 equivalent and as a result will never have the same shortened url.
